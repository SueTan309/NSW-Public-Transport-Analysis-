# 🚉 NSW Public Transport Analysis  

## 📌 Portfolio Overview  
This project explores **public transport usage patterns in NSW**, covering **trains, metro, light rail, and ferries**.  
The aim is to identify **key insights and trends**, evaluate the **most reliable travel modes**, and understand how travel behavior has changed over time — particularly post-COVID. Data in this project is collected in https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- **Data Cleaning & Integration**: Combined multiple open datasets from Transport for NSW.  
- **Dashboard Development**: Built an interactive **Power BI dashboard** using Power Query and DAX.  
- **Insight Extraction**:  
  - Trains are the dominant mode of travel.  
  - **March is the peak month** (students return + Autumn tourism 🍂).  
  - Passenger numbers are **still below pre-COVID levels**, with external factors contributing to slow recovery.
